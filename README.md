# Hello there!

I'm Epi, I'm a amatur programmer and a highschool student. I mainly code projects that I find interesting, or find useful for my daily life. So far, I've experimented with API, automation, networking, and security. I work on random projects from time to time, If you wish to assist me or give advice in anyway, feel free to contact me through any social medias I've linked below.
